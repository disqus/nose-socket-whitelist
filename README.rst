nose-socket-whitelist

A `nose <http://nose.readthedocs.org/>`_ plugin that patches ``socket.getaddrinfo``

    logs the test(s) where sockets are opened, printing a summary report to
    ``sys.stderr`` when all tests have finished executing

``socketwhitelist.plugins.ErroringSocketWhitelistPlugin``
    causes the offending test to fail with a ``SocketError``
